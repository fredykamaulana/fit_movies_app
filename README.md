# fit_movies_app

This is a movie project which built for skill enhancement purpose.

## Getting Started

# How to run the project
- Clone the repository
- .evn file is not included in the repository, so you need to create it and add your own TMDB_API_KEY=token variable.

# Bug must be solved
- [Movie List Screen] stack layout, long title will overflow the screen, so it needs to be fixed.
- [Movie Search Screen] infinite scroll is not working seamlessly, so it needs to be fixed.
